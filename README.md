### Title: 

Pharmacovigilance Reporting Case: A Machine Learning Approach

### Problem Statement

Many adverse events (AE) have been reported to the FDA by health practitioners, pharmaceutical companies, or patients every day. In the worst-case scenario, the adverse effects caused by the medicinal products could lead to fatality if there are no prompt actions taken to prevent or minimise these events. This issue has become more challenging as, most of the time, these unfortunate events occurred unpredictably. Therefore, it is crucial for the pharmacovigilance practitioners and their organisations to predict the pharmacovigilance reporting cases in managing the risk of the dreadful situation and mitigate complicated future decisions. Moreover, this will be advantageous to the pharmaceutical companies in ensuring the quality assurance of their medical products is within controlled.

### Research Objectives:

+ To identify and classify the drugs according to their risk level based on the adverse reporting effects
+ To implement supervised learning algorithms on the pharmacovigilance reporting cases.
+ To evaluate the performance of different machine learning models by using several performance metrics.

### Research Questions:

+ Which drugs are considered to have a higher risk and lower risk based on the drug’s adversity effects in the reported pharmacovigilance cases?
+ What algorithm works the best in predicting the severity of the pharmacovigilance reporting cases?
+ Which machine learning algorithm has the highest performance?

### Expected Outcome:

As machine learning is shown to be capable of detecting ADR and ADE for larger datasets, we hypothesised that machine learning might also be able to identify and classify the drugs’ severity risk level based on various input variables in the reported pharmacovigilance cases in SRS. Thus, this classification may be useful for drug safety surveillance activities, particularly with the prediction of reporting pharmacovigilance cases by using different algorithms from supervised learning.

### Methodology:

#### Data Collection

For the purposes of this research project, quarterly data encompassing quarter 1 (Q1) until quarter 4 (Q4) data from 2018 will be collected. This FAERS data can be retrieved from the [FDA website](https://fis.fda.gov/extensions/FPD-QDE-FAERS/FPD-QDE-FAERS.html).
